# LearningSelenium
Exposing myself to Selenium using C#. 

This first test I am conducting has the goal of verifying the title of Minitab's website. To do so, I used NUnit unit-testing framework, WebDriver web framework to enable execution of the test on Google Chrome's browser, OpenQA Selenium to encapsulate aspects of the browser, and C# as the programming language. 

This test is designed no open minitab.com website on Google Chrome and confirm the inserted string for their Full Title corresponds to the title element of the website. If it does correspond, test passes. If it does not correspond, test fails. Test can be conducted automatically without user participation. 

To verify my code, open file that ends with .cs here on Github. To run the code, use Visual Studio code and make sure to install the necessary extensions. 

Inspiration for the project stemmed from Coursera Guided Project taught Saurabh Dhingra.
